Hello and welcome to Tasteful Tooltips! This module adds tooltips to common conditions for dnd5e, such as grappled or poisoned, as a quick and easy reference to what that condition means.

This works without the user having to write any code. So long as the word exists in a document, ex. "frightened", Tasteful Tooltips automatically updates that word to activate the appropriate tooltip on hover.

## Manifest
Should you decide to manually install this module, here is the manifest URL for your convenience:

```
https://github.com/drakonik2782/tasteful-tooltips/releases/latest/download/module.json
```

## Disclaimer
This module adds custom CSS to modify the appearance of Foundry's default tooltip, which may conflict with any other modules that rely on tooltips.

## A Word of Thanks
This goes out to the community of the Foundry discord server for tips and recommendations I needed in order to make this work. Thank you!
